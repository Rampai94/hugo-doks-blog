Quotes

> The key to life is not accumulation but contribution, they say. Smokers do both. Accumulate as well as pass on smoke.

> Condoms and smokers both do similar jobs. The former prevent birth while the latter take care of the already born.

> Even LIFE tells you: Live It For the Experience!

> Life was never meant
to teach us how to fall!
It has always been about rising up. 
Rise up through the ranks, 
rise to the occasion, 
rise above obstacles 
and 
rise over your seat on a two-wheeler
when you see no other way 
to avoid the pothole in front.

> Love is truly a powerful force. It can make even the lazy ones run errands.

> Silence is golden; sarcasm is the icing on the cake!

> She came like a breeze. 
In the scorching heat of the sun. 
He enjoyed the time spent. 
Started building castles in his dreams with her as the princess. 
She was ignorant however. 
Never came to know. 
Of the feelings of her secret admirer.
One fine day he mustered up the courage. 
With all earnest left for opening up his heart to her.
He was ignorant however.  
All along she was in excruciating pain. 
Maybe this was why she was growing so cold emotionally. 
She equally looked forward to the moments spent. 
Moments innumerable, that made her feel special,
To be vulnerable and fall into his arms. 
But she knew. She couldn't because he didn't.
He said she was the most beautiful woman he had ever met. 
That he loved her. 
He asked her if she did. 
She knew the need to belong to him,
But she knew she couldn't pass on the pain. 
So she suffered alone and so did he 
But in their own different ways. 
Time played its part,
Healed the wounds but left behind scars.
Scars that gave millions of memories to them both,
To just replay in the head the moments spent.

Do it for free until you turn capable enough to charge for it!

> The biggest satisfaction is to see a smile on the face of your loved one!

> 
You try escaping them but they are so huge that they will block your growth. 
You decide to overcome them and they will deplete you of all resources that are necessary for your survival.
They will hit you where it hurts the most and suck out all the energy out of you. 
Fatigued, and full of exhaustion, you will gasp for breath, but they won't budge a bit. 
Because that's what their innate behaviour is. You are left with only two choices:
To match their level of rigidity, resourcefulness and rise above them,
Or 
Perish in them. They will engulf you and won't leave a sign of you behind.
But if you do overpower them, they will bestow upon you a blissful joy that is unmatched, unparalleled and leave you craving for more. A calm that can only be known once you get past all the struggle. You will unravel all things beautiful that lie hidden behind the tough exterior.
Mountains. The perfect symbolism for all problems in life!

> A letter from a convict:
As I stepped out of the jail, I felt lucky for having got that second chance. 
It all dawned upon me.
How easy it was to free off myself from the chains of Fear. 
Fear that appeared impregnable at first but was actually hollow from within. Fear that just needed a small smack across the face to turn impotent. Fear that was nothing but a snake without fangs.
Fear that had compelled me to hurt all those who cared for my well being. The one that had got the better of me.
A question that goes on incessantly in my head: Why didn't I gather up the courage earlier?
I have fallen once, but that doesn't make me weak. Because now I know how empowering Truth can be. With the burdening shackles of insecurities gone, I feel light. I feel rejuvenated.
Now I know myself better. I want to be a part of your life again. I want you to accept the real Me. 
Life has given me a second chance, won't you?

> You gave me birth, taught me to talk;
Holding my finger, you made me walk.
And then came friends, people of my age;
Slowly I moved to, my life's next stage.
Playing in the rain, I used to get ill;
But without any complaints, you nurtured me still.
Some things not to be done, was told by you;
Out of curiosity, I still used to do,
And then I came to you, bruised and battered;
You were there with me, always when it mattered.
Sacrifices you made, for my better future;
Gratitude to you, was still not in my nature,
Young and naïve I was, nothing I knew;
You guided me throughout, till mature I grew.
Independent I became, took my own decision;
Your support was although there, there was never any cessation.
When upset I grew, it hurt you the most;
When happy I was, your joy knew no bounds.
A smile on my face, would make your day;
You never let any trouble, come my way.
Words are insufficient, to completely describe you;
For people like you, are extremely few.
Nothing much I can do, to repay your debt;
All I can do, is say 'Thank You', 
Thank you mom, Thank you dad;
You are the best , anybody could ever have had. Anybody could ever have had!

> If you cannot water a sapling, at least refrain from hurting its roots.
If you cannot help someone grow, at least refrain from pulling them down. 
Genuine criticism is welcome but undue nagging can leave behind scars which are irreparable!

> Earlier, 
we used to go out
to play and 
get some fresh air.
After few years, 
we might stay at home
to play and 
get some fresh air.

> Happy moments are like flowers. 
If you let bees feed upon them, they would keep emanating fragrance all around.
Pluck them for yourself and they wither out in a while.

> Most of the love that we experience is ephemeral. 
Time kills all grief. Even the one caused by that special someone.
When the attraction wears off, 
When the distance magnifies, 
When reality comes into picture, 
If you still feel something for a special someone, 
That's true love! Or maybe not! 
Just give it a thought.

> When belongings are no longer meant to be only yours,
When happiness and grief are not meant to be only yours, 
When finances are not meant to be only yours,
When opinions to be heard are not meant to be only yours, 
When relatives are not meant to be only yours, 
When your name is not meant to be only yours,
When you yourself are not meant to be only yours,
It's time to realize that the bed you sleep in is also no longer only yours!

> Patience and laziness together make for a lethal combination. 
It can make you wait till the very bitter end of something only to land you in more trouble.
-- Vipin Balan

> Laziness misunderstood as patience is a blunder.

> An ounce of vice can make a pound of virtue seem insignificant.

> You are the one with whom I wish to awaken, 
You are the one with whom I wish to go to bed, 
You are the one with whom I wish to have always spoken, 
Every word, every phrase, I have ever said.
You are a distant dream come true,
People like you are truly very few.
The only thing I find it difficult to do, 
Is to confess that I love you. 

> Every habit starts with a 'why not try it out once'.
The easier the habit to cultivate, the longer it lasts. 
Often culminating into unmanageable addiction.

> The faster you breathe, the sooner you die. 
The more you eat, the sooner you end up with health issues. 
The faster you drive, the sooner you get out of control. 
Extreme of anything is an open invitation to death.
Same is with addiction.
Regulated and controlled activity is what life prefers it seems.

> Most potent when accompanied by loneliness.
Often pushing you to the limits.
Testing your endurance.
Sending shivers down your spine.
Reminding you how strong you can be! 
Dark and Cold nights they are.

> Who must have thought 
that some day,
The very clothes that 
you use to protect your body,
Will become the basis of 
judging your character!

> When a machine breaks down, 
you fix it or 
replace it with a new one. 
When a human breaks down, 
you don't fix one;
you take care of them. 
You nurture them and remind them of their true worth.
Their true place in your life.

> I will move on. But not by forgetting you. 
For you are the one who made me realize what I am worth of!

> Then, 
'Go out and breathe some fresh air. You will feel better'. 
Now, 
'Outside air is polluted. Get fresh air right under your roof.'
Times are changing,
so is the air around us!

> Words of a workaholic :
Work does not frustrate me, 
Lack of it does.

There will be people who have spent years in helping you grow, there will be some who come and go every few months, and there will be people who spend hours daily with you. 
You have the power to influence a lot of people at once. Use it to spread cheers and happiness around.
One strong shoulder is enough for you to cry. Use the others to spread positivity around. Because you can make a difference.

> Actual Experience Matters!

play such an important role

Belongings of the self,

And belongings of others, 
when they are no more.

> What's going on in the mind of a building experiencing rain for the first time!
With many months of toil,
and the highs and the lows,
Masons and labourers,
Laid my columns and rows.
But that wasn't enough,
For the conditions had been rough,
I needed your support,
To make myself robust and tough.
The sun was blazing,
Making it difficult for me to thrive,
With every passing day,
Even harder I had to strive.
Providing the much needed succour,
You came upon as a boon,
I had been through winter and summer,
Now it was time for the impending monsoon.
Every drop of yours
Strengthening every brick,
Ensuring that I stand strong
Through thin and thick.
Parched I was,
You navigated through my curves,
Quenching my thirst,
You soothened my nerves.
The ambience was harsh,
And water had been sparse.
Seeping through my pores,
You strengthened my cores.
Sturdier, and mightier,
now that I feel,
I am ready to provide shelter,
With a hitherto unknown zeal.

> आजकल तो खुले में भी घुटन महसूस होने लगी है। 

> Some people are like painkillers. 
You turn to them when
you can take it no more! 

> There is a difference between
'Memories of the mind' and 'Memories of the heart'. 
The former can ebb over time but 
the latter stays with you forever. 
While the mind 'Memorizes', 
the heart 'Remembers'.  

> Pen and paper are the most understanding friends 
you can ever get. 
Pen never stops you from expressing what's in your mind, 
Paper doesn't complain whether you put it in a book or it ends up in the dustbin!
Together they ensure that 
you clear up the clutter that lies 
above your shoulders.

Deliver your product concealing them.  

> You can always be .........
If you are not already.

Relationships clear.
Now the other way round?  

> Nature loses its sheen,
Without the green.  

> You caressed me when I was ill,
Ensured that I took the pill.
Mouthwatering delicacies you made for me,
Heavenly food it was and that too all for free!
I should grow to become big,
Is something that you aspired.
I would come from a tough day at work,
And in kitchen you perspired.
Every drop of sweat that you shed near the stove,
Was an indication of your impartial, incessant love.
Hot dosas you would make,
Served with coconut chutney and butter.
All the mess I used to make,
Your aged hands would declutter.
Your heart was pure,
Your manners demure.
To every ailment of mine,
You almost always had a cure.
The wrinkles on your face,
Were your best embellishments.
The tummies that you filled,
You would consider as accomplishments.
Your never-say-die attitude,
Is something for us to imbibe,
Your determination to finish your work,
Is something hard to describe.
No matter how much sick,
Your mind you used to trick,
Feeble you turned in the end,
But would still work with the aid of your walking stick.
As I watched you dead,
Lying on your deathbed.
Not a drop of tear,
Could I shed.
Your death is shocking,
My mind wants to disbelieve,
That you are no longer around me
It is unable to perceive.
It was however imminent,
You had to die someday.
But I had hoped that 'the day',
Would be somewhere far away.
My mood is pensive,
My grief extensive.
I can go on and on with more anecdotes,
Can be even more comprehensive.
But I would hereby stop,
Hoping that you would be somewhere atop.
In the vast sky, you would be a shining star,
Watching us all from not so afar.
You would often tell me,
How you wished you had education.
But with so much of childlike curiosity,
You were no less an inspiration.
Thank you Anama, thanks a lot,
You gave me precious memories,
Be happy wherever you are now,
Please do have no worries. 

> Knowing what to do comes naturally to most people,
Doing it requires practice.  

> We first work to satiate hunger.
And then end up sacrificing hunger for work. 

> What keeps us going?
Cravings of the body.
Or
Cravings of the mind.  

> Perplexing!
How only a word from someone can make your day,
While even a barrage from the rest turns out to be deafening!

> When you are sure about who you are, you can be what you intend to be!  

> Some people want to be loved but shudder at the very thought of being vulnerable.  

> Where there is a will,
There is a way,
You need money,
Just enough to pay.  

> You want connection, yet you push people away.
-- Loreth Anne White (In the waning Light)  

> Use your intellect to filter out options,
But follow your heart to choose the best one. 

> You make me want to be a better version of myself!  

> Is it a crime to strive for perfection in a world of imperfections?  

> I wish some days never ended.
Like the ones in which we poured over our hearts to each other.
I wish some days never materialize.
Like the ones in which we would no longer be doing the same.
No longer talking to each other.
No longer finding each other's mistakes when together and defending those when in front of others.
No longer thinking about how to bring a smile on each other's face.
No longer waiting for that notification to be a reply to the last message sent.
No longer finding a new reason to be together.
But days are stubborn,
They can't stay without nights.
And nights in turn can't live without the days.
Both do turn out unfailingly to meet each other.
Not knowing what pangs of separation are like.
Not knowing what losing a loved one is like.
Not knowing what forgetting someone you love is like.
Not knowing what matters of the heart are like. 

> वो गरमी ही क्या जिसमे पसीना ना आए,
वो दृश्य ही क्या जिसमे हसीना ना आए! 

> Somewhere in the city's hustle and bustle,
Do the leaves sway and rustle.
Away from the rising towers,
Does lie hidden the beauty of flowers.
All it takes is a peaceful walk,
To let nature talk.  

> Do your best.
Let Karma do the rest. 

> There was a time 
when I used to complain,
What is the government
doing for me?
Now is a time 
when I think,
What can I do for helping good governance?  

> You don’t need words to tell stories, You just need an understanding of emotions and an imagination that can bring those to life.  

> Email

Ecommerce
Eticket
Ebusiness
Emoney.
Ego?  

> There are two ways you can leave a legacy behind. 
You can show others what to be, 
Or
Show them what not to be!  

> When you are down and out.
And out and about,
Sometimes all it takes is a single push.
Sometimes all it takes is a pat on the back.
When you have no one to care,
But innumerable things to share,
Sometimes all it takes is a keen ear.
Sometimes all it takes is a smiling face.
When you see all the roads closing in,
When you see only nights but not the day,
Sometimes all it takes is for someone to guide you,
Sometimes all it takes is eyes that show the way.
When situations have made you crumble,
And all you could do is grumble.
Sometimes all it takes is a hand that lifts you up.
Sometimes all it takes is a supportive shoulder.
When others' demands have left you tired,
When unpleasant happenings have transpired,
Sometimes all it takes is a rock solid support.
Sometimes all it takes is a wall to lean on.
When crying for hours has left your eyes swollen,
When all that you ever wanted seems to have been stolen,
Sometimes all that is needed are legs that would do all the running.
Sometimes all that is needed are fingers that can wipe the tears.
Sometimes not being able to think can be good,
Sometimes following the heart can be good. 

> आज की चटनी में वो बात नहीं,
शायद वो रोज़ वाले शेफ का हाथ नहीं | 

> Growing up is all about: Using your learning
to generate an earning and 
suppress the hunger that's burning with the end being
people crying in your 
mourning! 

> The times are changing but so are my mistakes!

> Being smart is an art that you cannot buy from your local mart.  

> It's not when someone comes but who comes into your life that changes you as a person.
Someone maybe with you forever but still not know you.
And with someone else you might feel an eternal connection, a latent bond waiting to be discovered.  

> Here a drop was wasted,
Somewhere a river went dry!  

> For once,
His anger wasn't annoying. It was justified.
For this time,
It was his body that was the culprit. Not the mind.
Cancer had made him aware of how fleeting life could be! 

> For once,
He didn't hit her as usual.
For this time,
It was he who was on the receiving end.
Cancer had hit him harder! 

> नज़रे मेरी ढूंढती थीं तुझे,
तू था की नज़र ना आया |
यूँ अकेला छोड़ गया मुझे, 
अब साथ है तो बस मेरा साया |
अब तो खुले में भी घुटन सी 
महसूस होती है, 
जीवन में है तो बस तन्हाई |
तू हाथ ना थाम सका तब मेरा , 
अब साथ है तो बस परछाई |

decisions              then

easily                 comes 

taken.                in between.

To create, something that you all would be proud of!
To make the most of this wonderful opportunity called
LIFE!
I will learn.
