Hi there! I am Ramachandra Pai (Rampai) and have been working as an AEM developer since the past few years. Other than programming, I have a passion for writing and music.

Through this blog I intend to share key learnings from my tech exploration journey in a simplified manner. Please consult official documentation before using any information for production purposes.

Feel free to communicate custom requirements through comments or messages, and I'll do my best to assist you.
