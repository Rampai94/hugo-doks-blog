[{"content":"Adobe Experience Manager or AEM is Adobe\u0026rsquo;s CMS offering and with more and more features coming out and aggressive promotion of the same, Adobe is doing a great job out there!\nWhy AEM? Imagine you have to maintain a heavy site which needs updates on a regular basis with a varied base of tech-savvy customers who would be looking for the most relevant and modern content across multiple channels!\nHow difficult it would be to manage such a site given the following reasons!\nCustomer and Content is King! You need a site to attract customers and when you are busy signing the deal, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to have the site management part bothering you. You need assets which can vary from images, videos, pdf documents, plain text documents, etc. which cannot be the same across devices. You cannot show the same image on a mobile that you would show in a desktop view (e.g. in case of images, you need lightweight ones on mobile devices for faster loading). But because most of the users have not fully shifted to using mobiles you cannot do away with giving support to desktops as well. There is the challenge of having to be consistent as well! Websites with a consistent experience across digital channels tend to garner brand loyalty from customers. You might need to change the content that is displayed on your website on a regular basis. But without losing track of what it was before! Which means you need support for versioning content and you would select which version to release as per business needs. You would need to cater to users from across the globe but that means the content shown in India cannot be shown to a user in USA! Personalisation is key to a great experience. You need to segment your users and show targeted content to them. How would you add profanity checks and manage the comments that are updated on your site? User Generated Content (UGC) is all the more important nowadays since they can provide insights to what the users are looking for. These and many more reasons that can be concerning to you when you are providing a digital solution to customers or managing a website yourself.\nAEM is a solution to all these with Artificial Intelligence and Content as a service (CaaS) for Headless CMS also being a part of the technology now.\nAnother good thing is that the AEM team is now working on integrating front-end technologies like Angular and React (this is still in Beta as on the date this article is being published and will be a part of future AEM releases), architects do not have to come up with custom solutions to support AEM integration with front-end frameworks for SPA anymore. With the core components on Github anyone can contribute in making the solution better than it was before and documentation has significantly improved.\nAs mentioned by Adobe itself,\nAdobe Experience Manager (AEM), is a comprehensive content management solution for building websites, mobile apps and forms. And it makes it easy to manage your marketing content and assets.\nWhat benefits does AEM provide? Being part of Adobe Marketing Cloud, it is easy to integrate it with other offerings from Adobe Cloud to provide a complete solution! Another reason is the support provided by Adobe. The true flavor of these Adobe technologies come out when they are used together instead of only one particular tool. So you can use Target and AEM, or Campaign and AEM, or incorporate all in one solution.\nSo, what are you waiting for? Let\u0026rsquo;s get started with AEM!
